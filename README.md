### 🎯 The Problem

Blind and visually impaired individuals face daily challenges understanding their surroundings. Traditional assistive tools often require physical interaction, which isn't always practical.

### 💡 Our Solution

NoonVision is a **completely hands-free** vision assistant. Just speak, and AI tells you what's in front of you. No buttons. No touching. Just your voice.

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Click anywhere** on the page to initialize
2. **Allow** camera and microphone when prompted  
3. **Say "Detect"** when you want to scan
4. **Listen** as NoonVision describes what it sees

That's it. The system automatically returns to listening mode after each scan.
