# 🦾 NoonVision – 100% Hands-Free AI Vision Assistant

**Completely Voice-Controlled Object Detection for Blind/Visually Impaired Users**

## 🎤 How It Works

1. **Camera runs continuously** - Live video stream always active
2. **Say "Detect"** - Automatically captures current frame
3. **AI analyzes** - YOLO detects objects in the image
4. **Speaks results** - "I can see a person and a laptop..."
5. **Auto-resets** - Ready for next detection immediately

**No buttons needed! 100% hands-free!**
